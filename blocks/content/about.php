  This site is meant to serve as an area for me to post things he's learned and created. It is not aimed to disperse opinions, but to publish certain creations and help me reflect upon my activities.</p>

<h2>about afeique</h2>
<p>
  I'm currently an IT Programmer/Analyst at the <?=b_link('http://rochester.edu/','University of Rochester')?> and a student of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at <?=b_link('http://cmu.edu/','Carnegie Mellon University')?>.

<h2>professional experience</h2>
<p>
   My professional development experience includes deployment and management of best-practice HTML/CSS/JavaScript websites using <?=b_link('http://apache.org/','Apache')?>/<?=b_link('http://dev.mysql.com/','MySQL')?>/<?=b_link('http://php.net/','PHP')?>/<?=b_link('http://jquery.com','jQuery')?> running on LAMP stacks. In my current job, I primarily work with the <?=b_link('http://codeigniter.com/','CodeIgniter')?> MVC framework. For this site, I created my own framework built upon MVC principles without being "strictly MVC." My Resum√©/CV is available on request.</p>

<h2>additional experience</h2>
<p>
  I also has a range of experience with other programming languages: perl, python, ruby, c, c++, assembly, shell scripting, and tcl with the tk toolkit. My preferred programming platform is Linux with either emacs or vim (I'm partial to both), but I have just as much professional experience working on Windows and Mac OS X (usually using Eclipse). Consequently, I'm not concerned about what operating system I use as long as I can get the job done.</p>
